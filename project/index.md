**Keywords:** ai, orthodontics, x-rays. 

## 1. Introduction

- [ ] Find literature about AI and Orthodontics x-rays.
- [ ] Analyze the literature and explain how ai or x-rays are beneficial.

## 2. Data Sets

- [ ] Finding data sets in Orthodontics.
- [ ] Can any of the data sets be used in AI?
- [ ] What are the challenges with Orthodontics data set? Privacy, HIPPA, Size, Avalibility
- [ ] Datasets can be huge and GitHub has limited space. Only very small datasets should be stored in GitHub.
      However, if the data is publicly available you program must contain a download function instead that you customize.
      Write it using pythons `request`. You will get point deductions if you check-in data sets that are large and do not use
      the download function.


## 3. Using Images

- [ ] Place a cool image into projects images in my directory
- [ ] Correct the following link, replace the fa number with my su number and thne chart of png.
- [ ] If  the image has been copied, you must use a reference such as shown in the Figure 1 caption.
 
![Figure 1](https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-314/raw/main/project/images/chart.png)

**Figure 1:** Images can be included in the report, but if they are copied you must cite them [^1].

## 5. Example of a AI algorighm in Orthodontics

- [ ] Identify the concrete data sets that will be used.
- [ ] Identify the concrete algorighm to analyze the data sets.
- [ ] Write the program.
- [ ] Verify that it works.

## 6. Benchmark

Your project must include a benchmark. The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common [^2]
 
## 6. Conclusion

A convincing but not fake conclusion should summarize what the conclusion of the project is.

## 8. Acknowledgments

- [ ] Gregor guided me throughout this process.
 
Please add acknowledgments to all that contributed or helped on this project.  

## 9. References


- [ ] Your report must include at least 6 references. Please use customary academic citation and not just URLs. As we will at 
  one point automatically change the references from superscript to square brackets it is best to introduce a space before 
  the first square bracket.
